    <p>
      As peptides become more popular in the development of new therapeutics, it is increasingly important to quickly optimize the synthetic and cleavage processes by isolating and identifying both the target peptide and its related impurities. Collecting and analyzing closely eluting impurities while isolating the target peptide saves time and effort, and provides additional information about steps that can be taken to improve the quality and yield of the peptide product.
    </p>
    <p>
      While peptide isolation is routine for groups involved in synthesis and cleavage, peptide isolation is also useful for scientists in research and discovery groups. Whether peptide studies are focused on how these complex molecules affect the body and are metabolized or on how peptides are isolated from naturally occurring sources, only small amounts are required for initial experiments.

      RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
    </h2>

    <p>
      The principles of scaling chromatography remain the same whether the objective is to increase the amount of sample isolated at one time on a large column, or to decrease the amount of product based on the immediate need for material to perform experiments which answer pertinent questions quickly. For these studies, a new aliquot of the crude synthetic peptide sample used in previous work was isolated using the same optimized and focused gradient, this time at a much smaller scale – on a 4.6 × 50 mm XBridge Peptide BEH C18 Column using the ACQUITY UPLC H-Class System configured with a WFM-A fraction collector.
    </p>

    <p>
      The crude peptide (2.4 mg) was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and filtered using a 13 mm Acrodisc GHP syringe filter. Whereas 10 μL was the maximum injection volume that maintained resolution between the peptide and its impurities on the 4.6 × 100 mm XBridge C18 Column used in previous work, geometric scaling to the shorter 4.6 × 50 mm column for these experiments reduced the injection volume to 5 μL.
    </p>

    <p>
      Likewise, the reduction in column length automatically reduced the gradient run time from 18 minutes on the 100 mm column to 9 minutes on the 50 mm column. With the target peptide peak and its closely eluting impurities eluting well before 36% B, the gradient conditions were adjusted to run from 28–32% B in 5 minutes, thus saving time in the method.

      Because of the complexity of crude synthetic peptide samples, shallow focused gradients with slopes of about 0.2–0.3% change per column volume are useful for resolving more sample constituents. In this configuration, the ACQUITY UPLC H-Class and WFM-A Systems provide sharp peaks, high resolution, and efficient fraction collection – ideal for small-scale peptide and impurity isolation.

        The ACQUITY UPLC H-Class System, with its low system dispersion, exact control of solvent composition, and accurate sample injection scheme, provided excellent chromatographic reproducibility. This is illustrated in Figure 2, where five peptide injections were overlaid and matched exactly.

        The Waters Fraction Manager-Analytical (WFM-A) was specifically designed to minimize peak dispersion during collection. Figure 4 emphasizes the benefit of low peak dispersion in the fraction collection valve with a comparison of chromatographic profiles obtained using the WFM-A and a traditional collector.

        With the collection method developed, the peptide and two closely eluting impurities were isolated from the crude sample in a total of ten injections. Because the ACQUITY UPLC H-Class System is so reproducible, all of the sample purification chromatograms were essentially identical. Figure 6 shows a representative chromatogram with the shaded areas indicating where fraction collection occurred.

        The fraction volumes were essentially identical for each of the compounds in each of the isolations (impurity 1, 0.29 mL; peptide, 0.55 mL; impurity 2, 0.33 mL). All fractions of each type were pooled, and an aliquot of each pool was immediately analyzed using two different gradients.

        The peptide product purity was 100% as determined by both the fast gradient (Figure 7) and the shallower focused gradients (Figure 8) used for fraction analysis. Slight differences in the purities of both contaminant peaks were evident as shown by the two gradients.

        While the fast gradient (3.38% change per column volume) showed impurity 1 to be about 83% pure, the shallow focused gradient (0.30% change per column volume) resolved yet another coeluting peak and reduced the estimated purity to about 77%.

        Impurity 2 had a purity of 98% using the fast gradient and 80% using the focused gradient, again due to better resolution of compound constituents. If higher purity contaminant fractions were required for subsequent studies, further method development would likely be needed.

  <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
    Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi have demonstrated something that quietly changes how experimental science can be done. Their research group has developed <strong>AILA</strong>, an Artificially Intelligent Lab Assistant that can autonomously operate an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM).
  </p>

  <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
    This work has been led by the group of <strong>Dr. Nitya Nand Goswami</strong>, along with <strong>Dr. N. M. Anoop Krishnan</strong>, and has been published in <em>Nature Communications</em>.

  <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
    For anyone familiar with <a href="/verticals/lifesciences/research/driveafm" class="text-[#Be0010] underline font-bold">AFM</a>, this is not a small step.

  <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl  text-[#E63946] font-[MaxOT] mt-8">
    Why This Matters
  </h2>

  <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
    Running an AFM is not a push-button task. It requires judgement. You choose parameters, interpret noisy signals, adjust feedback, decide when something is wrong, and decide what to do next. Most of this depends on experience built over years of hands-on work.
  </p>

  <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
    AILA is designed to take on that responsibility.
  </p>

  <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
    The system can plan experiments, run AFM measurements, make decisions in real time, analyse the data, and adapt the next steps without human involvement. Tasks that earlier took several hours, or sometimes a full day, can now be completed in minutes.
  </p>

  <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
    This is not simple automation. It is an intelligent loop where decisions, experiments, and interpretation are tightly connected.
  </p>

  <!-- H2 -->
  <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl text-[#E63946] font-[MaxOT] mt-8">
    A Shift from Assisting Science to Doing Science
  </h2>

  <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
    Until now, most AI tools in research helped after the experiment was done. They analysed data, generated plots, or assisted with writing. AILA moves into a very different space.
  </p>

  <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
    It interacts directly with real laboratory hardware. It controls the instrument. It responds to what it observes. It learns from outcomes and adjusts its behaviour.
  </p>

  <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
    Operating an AFM demands an understanding of nanoscale physics and real-time feedback control. The fact that an AI system can handle this autonomously marks an important shift in how we think about experimentation itself.
  </p>

  <!-- H2 -->
  <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl text-[#E63946] font-[MaxOT] mt-8">
    What This Enables
  </h2>

  <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
    Autonomous experimental systems like AILA open the door to faster discovery, better reproducibility, and more efficient use of high-value instruments. They reduce dependence on manual trial and error and allow researchers to explore larger experimental spaces in a structured way.
  </p>

  <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
    This has clear implications for materials science, nanotechnology, surface science, tribology, and other areas where AFM is a core tool.
  </p>

  <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
    It also points to a future where laboratories do not stop when people leave for the day, and where every experiment feeds learning back into the system.
  </p>

    Inkarp Perspective
  </h2>

  <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
    At Inkarp, we pay close attention to developments where artificial intelligence meets real laboratory instrumentation. Work like this from IIT Delhi shows where advanced research labs are heading.
  </p>

  <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
    As instruments become more intelligent and workflows become more autonomous, the role of technology in shaping research outcomes will only grow. This work is a strong example of that direction.

      Semiconductor research and manufacturing </a>are inseparable from silicon wafers, and one of their most critical characteristics is surface roughness. Even minute irregularities can significantly influence device performance. Excessive roughness can reduce the mobility of electrons and holes, directly affecting electrical efficiency and reliability. Its impact goes far beyond electrical behavior, influencing adhesion, photolithography precision, optical properties, and overall device durability throughout the manufacturing process.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
      A rough wafer surface can scatter charge carriers, increasing resistance and reducing efficiency in high-performance CPUs, GPUs, and memory chips. It also affects thin-film adhesion, compromises photolithography accuracy, and can degrade optical performance in LEDs and solar cells. In addition, surface irregularities may introduce cracks and defects that reduce yield and long-term reliability.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
      For this reason, semiconductor manufacturers continuously monitor wafer roughness, defined as the root mean square (RMS) of height deviations from the mean surface, typically measured in the sub-nanometer (angstrom) range. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is the natural choice for such measurements. However, traditional dynamic modes have long been limited by slow scanning speeds. This limitation is now overcome with Nanosurf’s WaveMode, available on the DriveAFM and the industrial Alphacen 300 Drive systems. WaveMode operates up to 15 times faster than conventional dynamic modes, establishing a new reference for sub-nanometer roughness measurements and positioning DriveAFM as the future standard in semiconductor metrology.

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
      WaveMode is enabled by CleanDrive technology, which uses a second laser to excite the cantilever photothermally off-resonance. Unlike other off-resonance implementations, WaveMode does not require or depend on subtracting parasitic background signals. This photothermal excitation overcomes the typical f/Q limitation associated with dynamic mode operation.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
      By incorporating the Fast Scanning option, which includes an additional piezo capable of rapidly following surface topography, the system achieves significantly faster response times and higher scanning speeds. In semiconductor production environments, this translates directly into increased throughput.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
      Another important advantage of WaveMode is the precise control of the tip–sample interaction, minimizing the risk of damage to both the wafer surface and the probe tip. Maintaining tip condition allows repeated measurements over extended periods without frequent replacement, lowering operational costs. As a result, WaveMode delivers highly reproducible measurements. Repeated measurements across different wafer locations remain consistent, even when performed over long durations. In datasets collected over nine consecutive days, the distribution of roughness values remained stable, confirming preserved tip quality and low-noise measurement performance from start to finish.

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
      Compared to traditional AFM dynamic modes, WaveMode is also notably easier to operate. In dynamic mode, the interaction regime—attractive or repulsive—depends heavily on parameters such as oscillation amplitude and setpoint, which determine the force between the tip and the sample. Minor changes in these parameters can easily shift the system between regimes, leading to unstable interactions.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
      WaveMode, by contrast, can be configured in just a few simple steps through an intuitive procedure. It provides visual feedback on the applied force, giving users clear control and confidence during measurements.

          q: "Why is surface roughness critical in semiconductor wafer manufacturing?",
          a: "Surface roughness at the angstrom and sub-nanometer level directly affects how semiconductor devices perform. Even tiny irregularities can reduce electron and hole mobility, increasing resistance and lowering efficiency in CPUs, GPUs, and memory chips. Rough surfaces also impact thin-film adhesion, photolithography precision, and optical behavior in LEDs and solar cells. Over time, these imperfections can introduce micro-cracks and defects that reduce yield and device reliability. Measuring and controlling wafer roughness is therefore essential for maintaining consistent quality and performance in semiconductor fabrication processes."

        {
          q: "How is surface roughness of silicon wafers measured accurately?",
          a: "Surface roughness of silicon wafers is commonly defined as the root mean square (RMS) of height deviations from the mean surface. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is widely used for this purpose because it provides nanometer and sub-nanometer resolution. AFM scans the wafer surface with a sharp probe, capturing precise topographical data. Advanced modes like WaveMode improve measurement speed and stability, allowing accurate roughness analysis without sacrificing resolution, making AFM the preferred technique in semiconductor metrology and wafer quality control."
        },
        {
          q: "What limitations do traditional AFM dynamic modes have in wafer analysis?",
          a: "Traditional AFM dynamic modes are often slow and sensitive to parameter changes such as oscillation amplitude and setpoint. Small adjustments can shift the tip–sample interaction from attractive to repulsive regimes, causing instability and inconsistent measurements. Additionally, conventional dynamic modes are limited by the f/Q factor, restricting response time and scan speed. These issues reduce throughput and make the process less suitable for high-volume semiconductor production environments where fast and reliable roughness measurement is essential."
        },
        {
          q: "How does Nanosurf WaveMode improve AFM roughness measurements?",
          a: "WaveMode uses CleanDrive photothermal excitation to drive the cantilever off-resonance with a second laser. This approach removes the need for parasitic background subtraction and overcomes the f/Q limitations of traditional dynamic modes. As a result, WaveMode enables scanning up to 15 times faster while maintaining sub-nanometer accuracy. This allows semiconductor labs and fabs to perform rapid, high-resolution wafer surface analysis with improved signal stability and measurement reliability."

          q: "What is the advantage of Fast Scanning in semiconductor wafer metrology?",
          a: "The Fast Scanning option adds a high-speed piezo that rapidly follows the wafer surface topography. This enables faster response times and significantly higher scanning speeds without compromising data quality. In semiconductor production lines, this translates directly into higher throughput and faster inspection cycles. Engineers can analyze more wafers in less time, improving process efficiency and maintaining strict quality standards in wafer manufacturing."
        },
        {
          q: "How does WaveMode ensure reproducible roughness measurements over time?",
          a: "WaveMode precisely controls the tip–sample interaction, reducing wear on both the wafer surface and the probe tip. This preservation of tip condition allows repeated measurements over long periods without frequent probe replacement. Studies over nine consecutive days have shown consistent roughness values across different wafer locations, demonstrating excellent reproducibility, low noise, and long-term measurement stability critical for semiconductor process monitoring."
        },
        {
          q: "Why is tip stability important in AFM wafer roughness analysis?",
          a: "Tip degradation can lead to inaccurate roughness readings and inconsistent results. In semiconductor metrology, even slight deviations can affect quality assessments. WaveMode minimizes tip wear through controlled interaction forces, allowing reliable measurements across multiple wafers and extended usage. This reduces operational costs and ensures consistent data quality for precise wafer surface characterization."
        },
        {
          q: "How fast can AFM measure wafer roughness using WaveMode?",
          a: "With WaveMode, a silicon wafer surface can be imaged at a 15 Hz line rate, acquiring a full high-resolution image in less than 34 seconds. This is significantly faster than traditional AFM modes, which can take several minutes for similar scans. This speed advantage is crucial for semiconductor fabs that require quick, repeatable surface inspections without compromising measurement accuracy."
        },
        {
          q: "Why is AFM preferred over other techniques for wafer surface analysis?",
          a: "AFM provides direct, high-resolution topographical measurement at the nanometer and angstrom scale, unlike optical or electron microscopy methods that may lack true surface height accuracy. AFM can measure surface roughness precisely without damaging the wafer. With WaveMode, AFM also offers speed and stability, making it ideal for semiconductor wafer metrology where both accuracy and throughput are required."
        },
        {
          q: "How does easy operation of WaveMode benefit semiconductor engineers?",
          a: "Unlike traditional dynamic modes that require careful tuning of multiple parameters, WaveMode can be set up in a few intuitive steps. It provides visual feedback on applied forces, helping engineers maintain stable measurement conditions. This ease of use reduces operator dependency, shortens training time, and ensures consistent wafer roughness measurements across different users and production shifts."

      Modern alloy design requires careful control of structure and properties. Mechanical metamaterials with nano- and micro-architected structures demonstrate properties that arise primarily from geometry rather than composition. Advances in fabrication now allow creation of both periodic and disordered architectures, enabling mechanical behaviors rarely seen in natural materials.

The structure of an alloy strongly influences its mechanical performance. Grain boundaries and phase boundaries restrict dislocation movement and directly affect plastic deformation. Therefore, understanding the arrangement, dominant orientations, and phase separation scale is essential to predict alloy performance.

      WaveMode NMA extends the capabilities of AFM into quantitative measurements on metal alloys, as reported in the peer-reviewed journal SMALL. Measuring high elasticity ranges in metal alloys requires stiff probes, which are more challenging to drive through photothermal excitation. Since photothermal actuation depends on a second laser heating the cantilever, stiffer probes require higher laser power for bending.

Variations in heat distribution lead to different bending patterns, determining the vertical motion of the probe over time. Understanding this behavior enables fast, quantitative nanomechanics without adding complexity.

   The Kolbe-Schmitt reaction is a fundamental carboxylation method widely used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of hydroxybenzoic acids. This process involves the reaction of phenolic compounds with carbon dioxide under basic conditions. Initially developed by Kolbe as a solid-gas reaction to synthesize salicylic acid, Schmitt later improved the methodology by employing elevated pressures to reduce phenol losses, increasing overall efficiency. Beyond industrial applications, the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction remains essential in laboratory-scale organic chemistry experiments and is a key reaction in organic chemistry training.

   This experiment aims to perform the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction on resorcinol (1,3-dihydroxybenzene) to yield β-resorcylic acid (2,4-hydroxybenzoic acid) through carboxylation in an aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. The product is subsequently analyzed using benchtop NMR spectroscopy, including HSQC NMR experiments, to elucidate molecular structure and couplings in aromatic compounds. This experiment provides students with hands-on experience in spectral analysis and dynamic insights into the behavior of organic compounds through spectroscopy.

  Synthesis of β-Resorcylic Acid
</h3>

<p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
  <strong>Reaction Setup:</strong> In a 100 mL round-bottom flask, 25 g of sodium bicarbonate, 5.9 g of resorcinol, and 60 mL of distilled water were combined. A magnetic stir bar was added, and the flask was attached to a reflux apparatus with an oil bath, reflux condenser, and magnetic stir plate.
</p>

<p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
  <strong>Heating and Reflux:</strong> The reaction mixture was heated to 100°C and refluxed for 2 hours. The temperature was then increased to 130°C for 15 minutes.
</p>

<p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
  <strong>Acidification and Crystallization:</strong> The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and transferred to a 400 mL beaker. With continuous stirring, 29 mL of hydrochloric acid (37%) was added slowly to prevent excessive foaming. The beaker was placed in an ice bath to promote crystallization.
</p>

<p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
  <strong>Filtration and Washing:</strong> The resulting precipitate was collected via vacuum filtration and washed with cold water.
</p>

  Recrystallization of β-Resorcylic Acid
</h3>

<p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
  The crude product was dissolved in minimal hot water in a 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask. Upon cooling, recrystallization was induced by placing the flask in an ice bath. The purified crystals were collected by vacuum filtration, yielding 3.30 g (40%) of β-resorcylic acid as a white solid.

  NMR Spectroscopy of β-Resorcylic Acid
</h3>

<ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700 space-y-2">
  <li>
    <strong>Sample Preparation:</strong> 15 mg of the recrystallized product was dissolved in 0.7 mL of deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6), filtered through cotton wool, and transferred to an NMR tube.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Proton NMR Spectrum:</strong> The 1H NMR spectrum displayed three characteristic signals corresponding to aromatic protons:
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
      <li>6.26 ppm (1H, 4JHH = 2.3 Hz, 5JHH = 0.5 Hz)</li>
      <li>6.34 ppm (1H, 3JHH = 8.5 Hz, 4JHH = 2.4 Hz)</li>
      <li>7.62 ppm (1H, 3JHH = 8.4 Hz, 5JHH = 0.5 Hz)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Additional broad signals were attributed to hydroxyl (–OH) and carboxyl (–COOH) groups.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>J-Coupling Analysis:</strong>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
      <li>3JHH (ortho coupling): ~8.5 Hz, confirming adjacent aromatic proton positioning.</li>
      <li>4JHH (meta coupling): ~2.3 Hz.</li>
      <li>5JHH (long-range coupling): ~0.5 Hz, indicating weak coupling due to proton separation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>HSQC NMR Experiments:</strong> The HSQC spectrum confirmed the connectivity between aromatic protons and their directly attached carbon atoms, further verifying the molecular structure.

    Discussion
  </h2>

   <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
The experiment successfully demonstrated the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction for carboxylation of resorcinol, yielding β-resorcylic acid as confirmed through spectral analysis. The proton NMR spectra exhibited expected couplings for an aromatic system, with well-resolved 3JHH, 4JHH, and 5JHH interactions. The HSQC experiments further provided insight into proton-carbon connectivity.
