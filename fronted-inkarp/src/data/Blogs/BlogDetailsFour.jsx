  Introduction
</h2>

<p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
  Polymer materials, such as Polyethylene (PE), are susceptible to oxidative degradation when exposed to oxygen, leading to a decline in mechanical strength and electrical properties. The oxidative stability of polymers is a critical factor in applications such as wire coating materials, where prolonged durability is required. Unlike thermal decomposition, which typically occurs around 400°C in an inert gas environment (e.g., nitrogen), oxidation-induced degradation can begin at significantly lower temperatures, often below 200°C, in the presence of oxygen.
</p>

<p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
  To enhance polymer stability, antioxidant additives are incorporated into PE formulations to prevent premature degradation. The effectiveness of these additives can be evaluated using Oxidation Induction Time (OIT), a parameter measured via Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The DSC curve provides insights into temperature dependence, the impact of catalyst effects (e.g., copper influence), and polymer aging.
</p>

<p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
  The OIT measurement follows a standardized process:
</p>

<ol class="list-decimal pl-6 text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700 space-y-1">
  <li>The sample is heated under a nitrogen atmosphere and stabilized at a predefined isothermal temperature.</li>
  <li>The atmosphere gas is then switched to oxygen.</li>
  <li>
    The exothermic peak, indicating the onset of oxidation, is recorded, and the time elapsed from the gas switch to this peak is determined as the oxidation induction time.
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700 pt-2">
  This study aims to assess the oxidative stability of PE by measuring its OIT at different isothermal temperatures, evaluating the catalyst effect of copper, and comparing different grades of PE.

  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-black pt-2">
  1. Temperature Dependence of Oxidation Induction Time
</h3>

   <div class="py-3">
    <figcaption class="text-center text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2">
    Figure 1 presents the DSC curve of PE at 205°C. Following the gas switch from nitrogen to oxygen, no significant changes were observed for 17 minutes, indicating the presence of antioxidant additives. However, beyond this point, an exothermic peak appeared due to oxidation, marking the OIT at 17.2 minutes.

    Figure 2 shows the OIT measurements at different isothermal temperatures (200°C, 205°C, 210°C, and 215°C). The results demonstrate that higher temperatures lead to shorter oxidation induction times, confirming the temperature dependence of the oxidation process.

  </div>

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-black pt-6">
  2. Influence of Copper as a Catalyst
</h3>
<p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
Figure 3 illustrates the catalyst effect of copper (Cu) on the oxidation induction time of PE. When Cu was in contact with PE, the OIT was significantly reduced from 17 minutes to 6 minutes, indicating that Cu accelerates oxidation reactions. This result is particularly relevant for wire coating materials, where Cu conductors may directly interact with the polymer insulation, affecting polymer aging and long-term polymer stability.
</p>

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-black pt-6">
  3. Comparison of Different Polyethylene Grades
</h3>

<p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
  Figure 4 compares the OIT of three different PE grades. The order of oxidative stability was found to be C &gt; B &gt; A, highlighting the variation in polymer stability across different formulations. This demonstrates the usefulness of OIT analysis for material evaluation and quality control in industrial applications.

<p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
 High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) demand consistently high laboratory water quality, especially during mobile phase preparation. The purity of water used directly impacts instrument sensitivity, reliability, and accuracy—particularly in critical applications like cannabis potency testing.
</p>

<p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
 Traditionally, laboratories have relied on HPLC-grade bottled water for such purposes. However, generating ultrapure water in-house using a robust water purification system offers a cost-effective and sustainable alternative. This study explores the use of the Arium® mini-plus in-house water purification system (producing ASTM Type 1 water) compared with commercial HPLC-grade bottled water for cannabinoid analysis in cannabis samples.

 <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl text-[#E63946] font-[MaxOT]">
 Materials and Methods
</h2>
<p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
Cannabinoid reference standards and the internal standard (ISTD) phencyclidine (PCP) were obtained from Cerilliant (Round Rock, TX) as individual substances. Ricca ACS Reagent Grade and HPLC-grade water were sourced from Quartzy, while ultrapure water ASTM Type 1 was produced using the Arium® mini plus system on the day of use. HPLC analysis was performed using a Shimadzu Nexera-i LC2040L 3D Plus system, equipped with a Restek Rapture ARC-18 column (100 mm×3.0 mm ID×1.80 μm) and a Restek UltraShield pre-column filter (0.2 μm frit), set at 30°C. The system operated in isocratic mode with a mobile phase of 25% aqueous (Water, 5 mM ammonium formate, 0.1% formic acid) and 75% organic (Acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. A sample volume of 1 μL was injected and detected using photodiode array detection across the 190-400 nm wavelength range.
</p>

<p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
A stock solution containing 17 cannabinoids and the ISTD at 100 μg/mL in methanol was prepared. This solution was serially diluted to create calibrators. Another stock solution of the same cannabinoids was prepared for use as a positive control. A 4-constituent control from a different reference standard source was included as a high control. A matrix methanol solution was prepared by grinding 20 mg of stinging nettle leaf (Urtica dioica) and extracting it with 20 mL methanol, followed by sonication, vortexing, centrifugation, and filtration, which was stored for calibrators, controls, and blanks.
</p>
<p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
Cannabis samples were processed by placing 1-2 grams of cannabis in a 50 mL centrifuge tube with a grinding ball and freezing it for 1 hour. The tube was then placed on a Geno Grinder for 1 minute at 1600 rpm. A 0.2-gram portion of ground cannabis was placed in a separate tube with 20 mL methanol for extraction, which was repeated three times using vortexing for 1 minute and sonication for 5 minutes. A 1 mL aliquot was removed, filtered, and ultra-centrifuged for 5 minutes at 14,000 rpm. After filtering, 100 μL of undiluted and diluted samples were added to 150 μL auto-sampler vials, internal standard was added, and the samples were analyzed by HPLC.

  Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), widely known as Teflon, is a high-performance polymer celebrated for its exceptional chemical resistance, low friction, and thermal stability. But what truly sets PTFE apart is its complex viscoelastic properties, which dictate how the material behaves under different stress, temperature, and frequency conditions. Understanding this behavior is crucial for optimizing PTFE’s performance across industries, from aerospace to medical devices. Let’s dive deep into the science behind PTFE’s dynamic viscoelasticity and what it means for real-world applications.

  Dynamic Viscoelasticity: The Science Behind PTFE’s Flexibility and Strength
</h2>

<p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
  PTFE’s viscoelastic nature means it exhibits both elastic and viscous behavior, making it capable of storing and dissipating mechanical energy. Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA), facilitated by Hitachi’s NEXTA® DMA200, is the key technique used to explore these properties, measuring critical parameters like the storage modulus, loss modulus, and complex modulus:
</p>

<ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700">
  <li>
    <strong>Storage modulus (E′):</strong> Represents the elastic portion of the material, indicating its stiffness.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Loss modulus (E″):</strong> Measures the viscous response, representing energy lost as heat.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Complex modulus (E)*:</strong> Combines E′ and E″ to give a complete view of the material’s mechanical response.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700 pt-2">
  The loss factor (tanδ), which is the ratio of E″ to E′, reveals crucial information about damping characteristics, highlighting how PTFE can absorb and dissipate energy – a key feature for applications involving vibrations or dynamic loads.
